A classic Asteroids arcade game recreated in Python using the Pygame library.

## üöÄ Game Overview

In this recreation of the iconic arcade game, you control a spaceship navigating through an asteroid field. Your mission is to survive as long as possible by avoiding or destroying incoming asteroids.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Spaceship Controls**: Navigate with WASD keys

  - `W` - Thrust forward
  - `S` - Reverse
  - `A` - Rotate counter-clockwise
  - `D` - Rotate clockwise
  - `SPACE` - Fire weapons

- **Asteroid Mechanics**:

  - Asteroids spawn randomly from the edges of the screen
  - Larger asteroids split into smaller ones when shot
  - Various asteroid sizes with different point values

- **Physics System**:
  - Vector-based movement
  - Collision detection for player-asteroid and shot-asteroid interactions

## üéÆ How to Play

1. Avoid colliding with asteroids
2. Shoot asteroids to destroy them and score points
3. Larger asteroids split into smaller ones when shot
4. Game ends when your ship collides with an asteroid
